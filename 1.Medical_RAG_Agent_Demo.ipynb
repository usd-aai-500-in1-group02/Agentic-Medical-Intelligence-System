    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities of our Agentic Medical Intelligence System system. RAG is an advanced natural language processing technique that combines the power of large language models with domain-specific knowledge retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Medical Document Retrieval System**: Semantic search through pre-ingested medical literature\n",
    "2. **Vector Database Integration**: Qdrant vector database with OpenAI embeddings for similarity search\n",
    "3. **Web Search Enhancement**: External knowledge retrieval via Tavily API when local knowledge is insufficient\n",
    "4. **Source Attribution**: Transparent referencing of medical sources with confidence scoring\n",
    "5. **Interactive Medical Consultation**: Context-aware medical Q&A system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Context\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG systems address the fundamental limitation of large language models - their training data cutoff and potential hallucination in specialized domains like medicine. By grounding responses in verified medical literature, we ensure accuracy and provide traceable sources for clinical decision support."
